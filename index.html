<h1>Data Mining & Visualization Software for Multicolor Flow Cytometry</h1>

<p>Multicolor flow cytometry experiments generate vast amounts of complex data and require sophisticated software for their evaluation. SPICE is a data mining software application that analyzes large FLOWJO data sets from polychromatic flow cytometry and organizes the normalized data graphically.</p>

<p>SPICE enables users to discover potential correlations in their experimental data within complex data sets. Many potential applications for SPICE exist: the software can be used to analyze any multivariate data set for which a series of nominal measurements and a single continuous measurement is available.</p>
