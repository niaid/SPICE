# Pestle 2 Release Notes

## 2.0018 BETA (2019-06-21)

[ [direct download link](https://niaid.github.io/spice/pestle/updates/Pestle20018.zip) ]

* The user manual is now available via "View User Manual" under the (?) button!
* Fixed bug where a redundant category would not be omitted if it was only made redundant because itâ€™s the background column and has only two unique values (thus making only one unique value upon export, making the column redundant).
* Fixed incorrect behavior when detecting naming collisions with matrix variable IDs.
* Fixed sum variable uniqueness bug that prevented using a previously-used matrix variable in a new sum variable.
* Fixed crash or misbehavior when deleting a text replacement.
* Fixed label UI appearance in light mode when running under Mojave.
* Fixed incorrect tooltip in the input data's merge behavior control.
* **Note: This is a brand new version rewritten from the ground up. Please check its output and especially its background subtraction math!**
