# Pestle 2 Release Notes

## 2.0019 (2019-07-12)

* New terms of use (attribution and EULA).

## 2.0018 (2019-06-21)

Pestle v2.0 is now officially released as of version 20018! Though it's been thoroughly beta tested, it's a brand new version, rewritten from the ground up. As such, *please check its output and especially its background subtraction math* before using any data it's processed in your research. Please report any problems or concerns you may find via the Request Support option in the Help menu.

* The user manual is now available via "View User Manual" under the (?) button!
* Fixed bug where a redundant category would not be omitted if it was only made redundant because itâ€™s the background column and has only two unique values (thus making only one unique value upon export, making the column redundant).
* Fixed incorrect behavior when detecting naming collisions with matrix variable IDs.
* Fixed sum variable uniqueness bug that prevented using a previously-used matrix variable in a new sum variable.
* Fixed crash or misbehavior when deleting a text replacement.
* Fixed label UI appearance in light mode when running under Mojave.
* Fixed incorrect tooltip in the input data's merge behavior control.

## 2.0017 BETA (2019-05-22)

* First auto-update-enabled, auto-updated version.
* Note: This is a BETA version. Please check its output and especially its background subtraction math!
